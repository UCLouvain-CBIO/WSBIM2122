# Collaborating with Git and GitHub {#sec-git}


## Introduction

Why ? Student's feedback on the difficulty of collaborative work on R code and 
rmd files. Git and GitHub are the tools that experts use for code sharing and 
collaborative work. 

What is version control : what is it, why (line-by-line difference, clarity), 
how does it differ from other tools (cloud/drive). 

## Theoretical concepts of Git and GitHub

Understand the theoretical concepts of using Git and GitHub: repo (local and 
remote), pull, push, commit, clone, conflicts, issues, pull request (which 
prevents conflicts). Explain with a concept map 


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Choose your username 
wisely as you might want to reuse it later and will have to share it.
**Should we ask them to share it on moodle or somewhere for the next exercise ?**

2. Create your own repository and open an issue on it.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

You have now been added to the WSBIM2122_GitHub_training repository.
**We need to add 1 or 2 simple files to the repo**

1. Reply to the first issue to verify that you're able to access the repo.

2. Create a new issue where you make a link to a file or a specific line of a 
file and assign it to yourself. 

3. Close that issue to mark it as done.

## Git and RStudio

It is possible to use Git through the RStudio interface to manage everything 
that is on a repository. This is useful if you're working mainly with R and 
want to use Git version control but also if you want to do collaborative work. 
The RStudio interface then allows a click-button way of using git that can be 
easier than the traditional command line. 

This section of the course is based on the *Happy Git and GitHub for the useR* 
[tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jennifer Bryan.

### Install Git

Git needs to be install on your computer so RStudio can call it, or to use it
through the command line. Installation is different depending on the operating 
system of your computer.

- **Windows users**

The easiest way is to install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), 
also called "Git bash". This allows to get Git but also a Bash shell that is 
useful to venture outside of R/RStudio. 

When installing Git for Windows, use the conventional location as it is going to
help other programs to find Git. RStudio prefers for Git to be installed in 
"C:/Program Files". Also, when asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, 
select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise,
use the defaults parameters.


- **macOS users**

On macOS, Git can be installed directly from the shell using this command : 

```{bash}
git config
```

This will open an offer to install developer command line tools, accept the 
offer and click on "Install".

This might have to be redone after upgrading macOS or the RStudio Git pane can
disappear from a system where it was previously working. 

### Connect RStudio to your GitHub repo

To connect RStudio to a GitHub repository, a personal access token (PAT) is needed.
This will act as an identifier for a specific GitHub user, along with the 
authorization the user has. You can thus NOT use your GitHub password as a 
way to connect to your repository using RStudio.

A PAT can be created on GitHub, in *settings > Developer Settings > Personal*
*access tokens > Tokens (classic)* or directly [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
Click on *Generate token (classic)* and configure you're token. You can configure :
- A name, that generally describes what you're using this PAT for.
- An expiration date, after that date the PAT won't work anymore. GitHub security
advises for 30 days but you can configure it to no expiration if you see fit. We
advise to put the expiration date to at least the end of the semester, in case
you want to use it for your projects. 
- What this PAT allows to do, it is recommended to select repo, user, gist and 
workflow.

Once you've generated the token, it will appear. Be careful, it is the only time
you'll be able to see this PAT so it is advised to copy it somewhere to store it.
Still keep in mind, this PAT is a password that allows you to modify your work so
avoid putting it somewhere public. 

Once a PAT has been created, you can clone any GitHub repository on your
local computer using RStudio. The easiest way of working with GitHub and RStudio
is to have a GitHub repository first. The only thing needed from GitHub is the 
cloning https address of your repo. To get it, go the repo page, click the big 
green button that says “<> Code” and copy the HTTPS URL address.

To clone your GitHub repo on your computer, open RStudio and create a new 
project. You'll then be able to chose to create a Version Control project and 
choose Git. Then you just need to paste the HTTPS URL of your GitHub repo and it
will be cloned as an R project.

The project will open and a new Git tab will appear in the "environment" pane of
RStudio. This is where you'll be able to manage all things Git related. A file
appears there once it has been added or modified from the GitHub version. Once 
a file is modified, you can click on "Diff" to open a new window that will show
you what has been changed in the selected file. You can then check the staged 
box, write a commit message and commit these changes. You then click push to 
send all that to GitHub. That's when you'll be asked to give your username and 
PAT. RStudio locally tends to remember the PAT so you shouldn't have to put it 
again. 

Note : If RStudio doesn't appear to find Git on your computer, go to *Tools > Global*
*Options > Git/SVN* and make sure that the Git executable points to where your 
Git executable is located on your computer.

You might also have seen a `.gitignore` file. This is a text file containing the
names of the files that have to be ignored by git and not pushed to GitHub. This
should usually contain your .Rproj but also all files bigger than 50 Mb as these
cannot be pushed to GitHub.

RStudio also allows you to have a look at the commit history, if you want to see
all the changes that have been done to the repo.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

1. Connect the repository you created in the previous section using RStudio.

2. Create a Rmd file locally on RStudio then stage, commit and push it.

3. Modify that Rmd and knit it. When commiting, have a look at how the 
modification are showed to you. Push it on GitHub and go see the compiled result
online. Also have a look at the commit online.

4. Modify the readme file on GitHub and pull it locally.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


## Git and command line

It is still interesting to know that, usually, all these things are done through
the command line. Here is how to do it :

- Clone the repo locally.

```{bash}
git clone url 
```

- Have a look at the files and what is different from the GitHub version.

```{bash}
git status
```

- Stage a file for commit.

```{bash}
git add file
```

- Commit the staged changes.

```{bash}
git commit -m ‘comment’
```

- Push or pull your changes.

```{bash}
git push
git pull
```

Note : For windows users, know that by installing git for windows, you've also 
installed git bash, a terminal that can be used to use Git through the command 
line. You can use it in the terminal pane of RStudio as long as you've configured
it correctly by selecting "Git Bash" in *Tools > Global Options > Terminal > New*
*terminals open with*

## Troubleshooting

Remind you of good practice: coordinate your work so that only one of you is 
working on the same thing, always pull before commiting, pull/push regularly,
work on different files. 

Cancel commit when forgot to pull before :	git reset --soft HEAD~1

Exercise with modification on Github and Rstudio and have to resolve it (check
errors with RStudio !).

Demonstration of pull requests as another useful concept.

## WSBIM2122 Project

How are they going to be able to use this for their project: we're going to 
create 4 private repos to which we'll add them and we'll put a README file with 
the experimental design and a data file with the data.
