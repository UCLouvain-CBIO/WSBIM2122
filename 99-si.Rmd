# Course and session information {#sec-info}


## Available platforms

Given the increased need for autonomous work, the students are free to
use any computers they prefer to for this work, including the
computers provided by the university, the cloud [Renku WSBIM2122
environment](https://renkulab.io/projects?q=wsbim2122&page=1&orderBy=last_activity_at&orderSearchAsc=false&searchIn=projects)
for details) or their own computers. They should also make sure they
have all the documents they need and use a system they are comfortable
with during the presentations and final oral exam.

## Project reports

The group projects constitute a significant part of the work and final
grades. The reports will be written in Rmarkdown (see \@ref(sec-rmd)
and references therein) and compiled into a final pdf file. It should
be structure as a scientific manuscript or thesis, including:

- An **abstract**, summarising the report.

- A short **introduction**, providing the necessary background to
  understand the report.


- A **material and methods** section describing the experimental
  design and the methods utilised.

- A **results** section describing and interpreting the results.

- A **conclusion** documenting the wider implications of the findings,
  possible follow-up experiments or analyses and any limitations of
  the methods and results discussed above.

- An **author contributions** section documenting the respective
  contributions of all authors. This section is particularly important
  as it will help us assess you involvement in the projects and guide
  the discussions during the oral exam. While all authors are
  expected to have contributed to the work and report, some will
  probably have specifically focused on different aspects of the
  work. These are areas where will dwell into more details.

Before handing in your reports, each group will present their
preliminary results. The group is free to choose the type of support
they want to use (slides, a report, an Rmd file, ... ). The emphasis
of the presentations will not be to present a polished report, but for
students and instructors to ask questions to highlight possible
improvements. You will then be able to use the output of these
questions and discussions, including those with other groups, to
improve your own group report.

## Session information {#sec-si}

The following packages have been used to generate this document.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'msmbstyle'
), 'packages.bib')
```

```{r si}
sessionInfo()
```

## R package setup {#sec-setup2}

To install all necessary packages to run all the code, please execute
the following code:

```{r pkgs, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='markup', comment=''}
pkgs <- .packages()
pkgs <- paste0('"', pkgs, '"')
cmd <- paste(sort(pkgs), collapse = ", ")
cmd <- paste0("pkgs <- c(", cmd, ")")
cmd <- strwrap(cmd)
for (i in 2:length(cmd))
    cmd[i] <- paste0("          ", cmd[i])
cat(cmd, sep = "\n")
```

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager"))
   install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(pkgs)
```
