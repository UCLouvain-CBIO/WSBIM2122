              generating high quality proteomics data. Although individual
              laboratories have developed quality control samples, there is no
              widely available performance standard of biological complexity
              (and associated reference data sets) for benchmarking of platform
              performance for analysis of complex biological proteomes across
              different laboratories in the community. Individual preparations
              of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome have been used
              extensively by laboratories in the proteomics community to
              characterize LC-MS platform performance. The yeast proteome is
              uniquely attractive as a performance standard because it is the
              most extensively characterized complex biological proteome and
              the only one associated with several large scale studies
              estimating the abundance of all detectable proteins. In this
              study, we describe a standard operating protocol for large scale
              production of the yeast performance standard and offer aliquots
              to the community through the National Institute of Standards and
              Technology where the yeast proteome is under development as a
              certified reference material to meet the long term needs of the
              community. Using a series of metrics that characterize LC-MS
              performance, we provide a reference data set demonstrating
              typical performance of commonly used ion trap instrument
              platforms in expert laboratories; the results provide a basis for
              laboratories to benchmark their own performance, to improve upon
              current methods, and to evaluate new technologies. Additionally,
              we demonstrate how the yeast reference, spiked with human
              proteins, can be used to benchmark the power of proteomics
              platforms for detection of differentially expressed proteins at
              different levels of concentration in a complex matrix, thereby
              providing a metric to evaluate and minimize pre-analytical and

                  of proteins impose important challenges on the data

                  dependent missingness of peptide
                  intensities. Peptide-based workflows, like MSqRob,
                  test for DE directly from peptide intensities and
                  outper-form summarization methods which first
                  aggregate MS1 peptide intensities to protein
                  intensities before DE analysis. However, these
                  methods are computationally expensive, often hard to
                  understand for the non-specialised end-user, and do
                  not provide protein summaries, which are important
                  for visualisation or downstream processing. In this
                  work, we therefore evaluate state-of-the-art
                  summarization strategies using a benchmark spike-in

                  to the state-of-the-art peptide based model,
                  MSqRob. Based on this evaluation, we propose a novel

                  two-stage procedure circumventing the drawbacks of
                  peptide-based workflows. MSqRobSum maintains
                  MSqRob{\textquoteright}s superior performance, while
                  providing useful protein expression summaries for
                  plotting and downstream analysis. Summarising
                  peptide to protein intensities considerably reduces
                  the computational complexity, the memory footprint
                  and the model complexity, and makes it easier to
                  disseminate DE inferred on protein
                  summaries. Moreover, MSqRobSum provides a highly
                  modular analysis framework, which provides
                  researchers with full flexibility to develop data
                  analysis workflows tailored towards their specific
                  applications.},

  abstract = "Mass spectrometry is unmatched in its versatility for studying
              practically any aspect of the proteome. Because the foundations
              of mass spectrometry-based proteomics are complex and span
              multiple scientific fields, proteomics can be perceived as having
              a high barrier to entry. This tutorial is intended to be an
              accessible illustrated guide to the technical details of a
              relatively simple quantitative proteomic experiment. An attempt
              is made to explain the relevant concepts to those with limited
              knowledge of mass spectrometry and a basic understanding of
              proteins. An experimental overview is provided, from the
              beginning of sample preparation to the analysis of protein group
              quantities, with explanations of how the data are acquired,
              processed, and analyzed. A selection of advanced topics is
              briefly surveyed and works for further reading are cited. To
              conclude, a brief discussion of the future of proteomics is
              given, considering next-generation protein sequencing
              technologies that may complement mass spectrometry to create a

               understanding of how the results of experiments are captured in
               annotations, in the hope that this will lead both to better
               representations of biological reality through annotation and
               ontology development and to more informed use of GO resources by
               experimental scientists.",
