# Preamble {-}

The [WSBIM2122](https://uclouvain.be/cours-2021-wsbim2122.html) course
is a project-based course that teaches the analysis of quantitative
omics data. It is composed of three major parts:

- Introductory material about (advanced) usage of R markdown for
  reports and slides, linear models, and utilisation and
  interpretation of gene set enrichment and over-representation
  analyses (GSEA).

- Project 1: analysis and interpretation of RNA-Seq data, including
  high throughput sequencing (HTS) data processing.

- Project 2: analysis and interpretation of quantitative proteomics,
  including mass spectrometry data (MS) and its processing.

Each project will entail an introductory lecture, dedicated office
time for students to ask questions, oral presentations of the data
analysis and interpretation, and submission of a fully reproducible R
markdown report. The students will be able to amend their final
reports after the presentations, benefiting from in-class feedback and
discussion. The report will contain an introduction, a description of
the experimental design of the data, a detailed description of the
data analysis steps, discussion and interpretation of the results,
including a biological interpretation, as well as references and
contribution statement of all authors.

The projects will be done in groups, with different groups for each
project. The number of students per group will be set once the total
number of students is known.

Tentative schedule for the course.

- Short presentations: shell (see \@ref(sec-cli)) and Rmd (chapter
  \@ref(sec-rmd)).
- Linear models (chapter \@ref(sec-linmod)).
- Project 1: lectures on HTS (chapter \@ref(sec-hts)) and RNA-Seq
  (chapter \@ref(sec-rnaseq)).
- Project 1 (cont'd): Gene set enrichment (chapter \@ref(sec-gsea)).
- QA session for project 1
- Project 1 presentations
- Submission of the 1st report
- Project 2: lectures on mass spectrometry (chapter \@ref(sec-ms)) and
  quantitative proteomics (chapter \@ref(sec-prot)).
- QA session for project 2
- Project 2 presentations
- Submission of the 2nd report
- Oral exams based on the submitted reports.

The course will be taught in English. The reports and oral exams can
be either in English or in French. The final mark will be based on the
submitted reports and the oral exam, tentatively about 50% each.


## Pre-requisites {-}

Students taking this course should be comfortable with data analysis
and visualisation in R. Formal pre-requisites for students taking the
class are the [WSBIM1207](https://UCLouvain-CBIO.github.io/WSBIM1207)
and [WSBIM1322](https://UCLouvain-CBIO.github.io/WSBIM1322).

Software requirements are documented in the *Setup* section below.

## About this course material {-}

## Setup {-}

We will be using the [R environment for statistical
computing](https://www.r-project.org/) as main data science language.
We will also use the
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) interface to
interact with R and write scripts and reports. Both R and RStudio are
easy to install and works on all major operating systems.

Once R and RStudio are installed, a set of packages will need to be
installed. See section \@ref(sec-setup2) for details.

The `rWSBIM2122` package provides some pre-formatted data used in this
course. It can be installed with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("UCLouvain-CBIO/rWSBIM2122")
```

and then loaded with

```{r rwsbim1322, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("rWSBIM2122")
```
